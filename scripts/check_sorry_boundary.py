"""Enforce the sorry boundary.

Policy:

1. Everything transitively imported by `ReverseMathlib.lean` — the production root spine
   — is sorry-free.
2. Work in progress lives under `ReverseMathlibExperimental/` and is never imported by
   the root spine. It may contain sorries; it still has to typecheck, which the separate
   `ReverseMathlibExperimental` lake target ensures.
3. Promotion into the root spine requires removing all sorries and passing the axiom
   audit. Promotion is the reviewable event: a file appearing in the transitive closure
   of `ReverseMathlib.lean` is a claim that it is finished.

This script checks 1 and 2. It computes the import closure from the source text rather
than from build artefacts, so it works on a clean checkout and cannot be fooled by a
stale `.lake`.

Usage: scripts/check_sorry_boundary.py   (from anywhere inside the repo)
Exit status 1 on any violation.
