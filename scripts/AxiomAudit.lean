# Axiom audit

Checks that the library depends only on the standard axioms `propext`,
`Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`. Run via `lake env lean scripts/AxiomAudit.lean`
(done by CI); any disallowed axiom is a hard error.

Two layers:

* **Environment sweep**: every declaration whose *owning module* is `ReverseMathlib` or
  a submodule is checked — including `private` declarations (whose mangled `_private.*`
  names defeat any namespace-prefix filter) and compiler-generated auxiliaries — so a
  `native_decide`/`ofReduceBool` (or any custom axiom) anywhere in the library fails the
  gate, whether or not the declaration is listed below.
* **Headline regression list**: `headlineDecls` is extended in every milestone; because
  the double-backtick names resolve at elaboration, a deletion or rename of a headline
  declaration also fails the gate.

The sweep only sees modules reachable from `ReverseMathlib`, i.e. the root import spine.
`ReverseMathlibExperimental.*` is deliberately outside it (see
`scripts/check_sorry_boundary.py`), so work in progress is not audited until it is
promoted.
